# to-do-list

Welcome to my web3 project.

It's a todo list created over a blockchain using solidity, javascript, metamask, ganache, html and css.
 It works same as a to-do list but over a smart contract written over a solidity code.
 You can add action items and after completing those action items you can remove those.
